# WeekÂ 5. Just ask.

Itâ€™s the 5th week, when Iâ€™m trying to work on my side business - tailored.ml.

ðŸŽ¯ The first milestone - first **payment** for the newsletter.tailored.ml

## Recap. The plan wasâ€¦

- Finish first module (and a homework for it!) from Paid Newsletter Academy at [eduworlds.com]()(https://eduworlds.com/). - Almost Done 
- Gain first feedback from potential customers. - DONE âœ…


I'm still following Paid Newsletter Academy at [eduworlds.com][2].
I'm going through the first module's homework.
And I've done very hard for me step, which is...

## Ask people

It's hard for me to start a conversation.
This week I started 10!
Each time, before I pressed enter to send a message, my heart was beating like crazy.
And it was beating even harder, when I heard the "BEEP" announcing new reply.

But I've done it and I'm proud of myself :)

I received 6 answers for now.  
I will continue this journey and gather feedback.

Besides that I've done some technical work.

## Platform Design

I do not want to send "just another mailing".
The content has to be tailored to the needs of the receiver.
To achieve that, I need special setup of the solution.

This week I've done first design of the tool with main components.  
All of them are no-code tools I can integrate, to achieve my goal.
It's still in my notebook, though ;)

## Plan for next week
- Setup the first version of the tool, with landing page to sign-up
- Write LinkedIn post annoucing the tool and asking for beta users ;)
- Write announcement on twitter. Write 5 daily summaries about progress in my project.
- Finish first and second module (and a homework for it!) from Paid Newsletter Academy at [eduworlds.com]()(https://eduworlds.com/).

## TL;DR:

- This week:
	- Expenses: 0$
	- Income: 0$
- Total:
	- Expenses: 20,59$
	- Income: 0$
