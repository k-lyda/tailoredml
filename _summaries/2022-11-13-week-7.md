# WeekÂ 6. Pause.

Itâ€™s the 6th week, when Iâ€™m trying to work on my side business - tailored.ml.
It's all because of the Global Contest by [Firestarters](https://transparentworld.pl/firestarters).

ðŸŽ¯ The first milestone - first **payment** for the newsletter.tailored.ml

## Pause

This week I've done almost nothing.

[One article on the blog](/blog/how-to-merge-jupyter-notebooks).


## Plan for next week
- Setup the first version of the tool, with landing page to sign-up
- Finish first and second module (and a homework for it!) from Paid Newsletter Academy at [eduworlds.com](https://eduworlds.com/).

## TL;DR:

- This week:
	- Expenses: 0$
	- Income: 0$
- Total:
	- Expenses: 20,59$
	- Income: 0$
