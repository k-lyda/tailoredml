# Week 2. No time… “Demons” from the past.

It’s the second week, when I’m trying to work on my side business - tailored.ml. 

The first milestone - first payment for the newsletter.tailored.ml

Steps taken during this week:

## Committed? Delivered.

Some time ago I’ve committed to deliver a training from Deep Learning.

So this week I was fully focused on preparing the material and delivering the classes.

Notes from students are pretty good, so I’m happy with the result.

When I was preparing the materials I was constantly thinking - how can I use those in my project? And I think I know. 

But more on that later… ;)

## Summary for Week 3

Yup, you read right. I've prepared summary for week 3.

Outstanding Move.
