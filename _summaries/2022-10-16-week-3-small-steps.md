# Week 3. Small steps. 
It’s the third week, when I’m trying to work on my side business - tailored.ml. 

The first milestone - first payment for the newsletter.tailored.ml

Still struggling with other projects as the obstacles on the road.  
I had very limited time.  
But even small steps can be beneficial.  
And I’m trying to do those.

Steps taken during this week:

## Follow the guide

I’m still ~~watching~~ doing the Paid Newsletter Academy at [eduworlds.com](https://eduworlds.com/). 
I’m following their guidance. 
I’ve seen the results, that the people behind the course can achieve, and I’m sure they know what they are talking about

## Automation would be crucial
Automation of this project would be crucial. I’m no jumping right know into it, cause it is too early.
But I had other task, that was for me a playground to learn more about [make.com](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=konradl) (formerly Integromat). 
I learn more and more about this tool (I’m using it for some time), and I see that it would be a great fit later in the project.

I’ve paid for a Core subscription (10,59$), which is my second expense related to this project ;) 

## Plan for next week
- Finish first module (and a homework for it!) from Paid Newsletter Academy at [eduworlds.com](https://eduworlds.com/)

## TL;DR:
- This week:
	- Expenses: 10,59$
	- Income: 0$
- Total: 
	- Expenses: 20,59$
	- Income: 0$
